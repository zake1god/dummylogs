# Graylog Dummy Log Generator

This Python script generates and sends dummy logs to a Graylog server in the GELF (Graylog Extended Log Format) format. It's useful for testing Graylog configurations and visualizations by simulating log data.

## Overview

The script connects to a Graylog server via UDP and sends 100 randomly generated log entries in the GELF format. Each log entry contains basic information such as the `host`, `short_message`, `level`, and a custom field (`_custom_field`). 

## Prerequisites

- A Graylog server configured to receive **GELF UDP** input on the desired IP and port.
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Configuration

Before running the script, update the following values in the script to match your environment:

```python
GRAYLOG_IP = '10.20.30.40'  # Change this to your Graylog server IP
GRAYLOG_PORT = 12201        # Ensure this matches the GELF UDP input port on Graylog
```

## How to Run the Script

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python send_dummy_log.py
   ```

The script will generate and send 100 log messages to the specified Graylog server. Each message will be displayed in the terminal as it is sent, along with the message content.

## Script Details

Here's a breakdown of the main sections in the script:

- **Graylog Configuration**: Set the IP and port of the Graylog server.
- **Socket Creation**: Establishes a UDP socket connection to send data to Graylog.
- **Log Generation**: The `create_gelf_log()` function creates a GELF-compliant JSON log message, with fields such as `version`, `host`, `short_message`, `level`, and a custom field `_custom_field`.
- **Sending Logs**: A loop sends 100 log entries to Graylog, with a short delay between each message for easier monitoring.

## Example Log Message

A sample log message generated by this script looks like this:

```json
{
    "version": "1.1",
    "host": "dummy_host",
    "short_message": "Test log message",
    "level": 3,
    "_custom_field": "custom_value"
}
```

Each log message includes a randomly assigned `level` between 1 and 5, simulating different log severity levels.
